Temper is a web application for tracking your mood and visualizing how it changes over time.

When you sign in you will be prompted to fill out a log entry for how you are feeling.

The UI allows you to view and edit all entries on a calender or see them on a graph.

This application uses React for the client and node.js/[feathers](https://feathersjs.com/) for the back end with MongoDB as the database. The data visualization uses [Vega](https://vega.github.io/vega/)
